# Data Architecture and Models: Reverse-Engineering-an-Existing-Database-to-Derive-the-Physical-and-Logical-Models

Data model reverse engineering is a data architecture approach through which Data Architects can create a database physical and/or logical model from an existing database. Database models graphically show the structure of a database so that Data Architects and decision makers can see how database elements, such as tables and views, relate to each other without showing the actual data. This process can help to streamline creating a new database or understanding the structure of an existing one.

In this discourse, a data model that is existing in a MS SQL Server database is reversed engineered to yield the data physical and logical models. ER/Studio is used for the reverse engineering procedure.
